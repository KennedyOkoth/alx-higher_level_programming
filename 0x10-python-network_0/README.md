# Project: 0x10-python-network_0

## Overview
This project focuses on building Bash and Python scripts to interact with web servers using cURL. The tasks involve sending requests, handling responses, and understanding HTTP fundamentals. The project also includes a technical interview preparation task involving finding a peak in an unsorted list of integers.

- All modules, classes, and functions should be documented with real sentences explaining their purpose (length will be verified)


## Tasks
### Task 0: cURL body size
- Write a Bash script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the size of the response body in bytes.

### Task 1: cURL to the end
- Write a Bash script that takes a URL, sends a GET request, and displays the body of the response for a 200 status code.

### Task 2: cURL Method
- Write a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to a specified URL and displays the body of the response.

### Task 3: cURL only methods
- Write a Bash script that takes a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.

### Task 4: cURL headers
- Write a Bash script that takes a URL, sends a GET request, and displays the body of the response with a specific header.

### Task 5: cURL POST parameters
- Write a Bash script that takes a URL, sends a POST request, and displays the body of the response with specific parameters.

### Task 6: Find a peak
- Write a function in Python to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

### Task 7: Only status code
- Write a Bash script that sends a request to a URL and displays only the status code of the response without using pipes, redirection, etc.

### Task 8: cURL a JSON file
- Write a Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL with the contents of a file and displays the body of the response.

### Task 9: Catch me if you can!
- Write a Bash script that makes a request to a specific URL, causing the server to respond with a message in the body of the response.
